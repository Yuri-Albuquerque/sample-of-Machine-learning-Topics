Certainly! The Gap Statistic method is used to determine the optimal number of clusters ($k$) in k-means clustering. It compares the dispersion of data points within clusters to that of a reference null distribution, aiding in identifying the suitable $k$ value for clustering.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to compute the Gap Statistic method:

1. **Perform K-Means Clustering**: Initially, perform k-means clustering on the dataset for a range of $k$ values, typically starting from a minimum value to a maximum value. This involves clustering the data into different numbers of clusters, say from $k = 1$ to a predefined maximum value of $k$.

2. **Calculate Within-Cluster Dispersion**: For each $k$, compute the within-cluster dispersion, usually represented as the sum of squared distances of data points from their respective cluster centroids. This measure is known as the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS).

3. **Generate Random Reference Data**: Create a reference null distribution by generating random data that preserves the original dataset's essential characteristics. Typically, this is done by creating a uniform distribution that covers the same range as the original dataset.

4. **Compute WCSS for Reference Data**: Apply k-means clustering to the generated reference data for the same range of $k$ values used in the original data. Calculate the WCSS for each $k$ in the reference data.

5. **Calculate Gap Statistic**: Compute the Gap Statistic for each $k$ using the formula:
   $$ \text{Gap}(k) = \frac{1}{B} \sum_{b=1}^{B} \log\left(WCSS_{\text{ref}}^{(b)}\right) - \log\left(WCSS_{\text{obs}}\right) $$
   - $WCSS_{\text{obs}}$ represents the WCSS of the original dataset for a specific $k$.
   - $WCSS_{\text{ref}}^{(b)}$ denotes the average WCSS for the $b$th random reference dataset for the same $k$.
   - $B$ is the number of reference datasets generated.

6. **Determine Optimal $k$**: Identify the optimal number of clusters by selecting the value of $k$ where the Gap Statistic reaches its maximum value. The idea is to find the $k$ that maximizes the gap between the actual WCSS of the dataset and the expected WCSS under the null reference distribution.

Choosing the $k$ value corresponding to the point where the Gap Statistic starts to plateau or significantly decreases helps in determining the most suitable number of clusters for the given dataset.

The Gap Statistic method aids in objectively identifying the optimal number of clusters by comparing the clustering results of the actual dataset to those obtained from random reference data, offering a robust approach for determining $k$ in k-means clustering.
