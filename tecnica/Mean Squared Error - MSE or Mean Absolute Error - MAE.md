Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) are both metrics used to measure the performance of regression models, but they quantify error differently, each having its own characteristics and implications.

1. **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**:
   - MSE is calculated by taking the average of the squared differences between predicted and actual values.
   - It penalizes larger errors more heavily due to the squaring operation. Consequently, outliers or large deviations have a greater impact on the MSE.
   - Mathematically, for a dataset with $n$ samples:
     $$ \text{MSE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 $$
   - The use of squared differences magnifies the effect of outliers, making the MSE sensitive to extreme values in the dataset.
   - It's differentiable and hence is often favored in optimization algorithms like gradient descent.

2. **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**:
   - MAE is computed by taking the average of the absolute differences between predicted and actual values.
   - It treats all errors equally without considering their direction (positive or negative).
   - Mathematically, for a dataset with $n$ samples:
     $$ \text{MAE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} |y_i - \hat{y}_i| $$
   - MAE is more robust to outliers because it does not involve squaring the errors, making it less sensitive to extreme values in the dataset.
   - It's less affected by outliers as the impact of large errors is not exaggerated.

**Differences**:
- MSE emphasizes larger errors due to squaring, making it more sensitive to outliers.
- MAE treats all errors equally, offering a more balanced view and robustness to outliers.
- The gradients in MSE decrease as the error approaches zero more rapidly than in MAE, influencing the convergence speed of optimization algorithms.
- In terms of interpretation, MSE might be less intuitive as it's in the squared units of the target variable, while MAE is in the original units, making it easier to understand the average magnitude of errors.

The choice between MSE and MAE often depends on the specific problem, the nature of the dataset, and the tolerance to outliers. MSE might be preferred when larger errors need more penalty, whereas MAE could be favored when robustness to outliers is more critical.
