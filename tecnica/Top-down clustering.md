In Python, there isn't a direct implementation of divisive clustering algorithms like DIANA (Divisive Analysis) available in scikit-learn or other widely-used machine learning libraries as of my last knowledge update in January 2022. However, you can implement divisive hierarchical clustering manually or with custom code.

The DIANA algorithm involves recursively partitioning a dataset into clusters based on divisive methods. Here's a simplified example of a divisive clustering approach using KMeans clustering as a basic algorithm for partitioning:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

# Generating sample data
X, _ = make_blobs(n_samples=300, centers=4, cluster_std=0.6, random_state=0)

# Recursive divisive clustering function
def divisive_clustering(data, num_clusters):
    if len(data) == num_clusters:  # Stop condition: number of clusters reached
        return [data]

    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=2, random_state=42)
    labels = kmeans.fit_predict(data)
    
    clusters = []
    for cluster_id in np.unique(labels):
        cluster_data = data[labels == cluster_id]
        clusters.extend(divisive_clustering(cluster_data, num_clusters))
    
    return clusters

# Applying divisive clustering
result_clusters = divisive_clustering(X, num_clusters=4)

# Visualizing the resulting clusters
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
for idx, cluster in enumerate(result_clusters):
    cluster = np.array(cluster)
    plt.scatter(cluster[:, 0], cluster[:, 1], label=f'Cluster {idx+1}')

plt.title('Divisive Clustering')
plt.xlabel('Feature 1')
plt.ylabel('Feature 2')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

Explanation:

1. `make_blobs` is used to generate synthetic data.
2. `divisive_clustering` is a recursive function that performs divisive clustering by using KMeans as the partitioning method. It recursively divides clusters into smaller clusters until the desired number of clusters is achieved.
3. The resulting clusters are visualized using a scatter plot.

This is a basic example and may not directly represent DIANA or specific divisive hierarchical clustering algorithms. Implementing these algorithms precisely might involve more complex strategies and detailed understanding of the specific divisive clustering method. If available, using specialized libraries or custom implementations might be required to execute these algorithms accurately.
