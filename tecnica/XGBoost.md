As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, the `XGBClassifier` from the XGBoost library is compatible with Python 3.11. However, library compatibility might change with updates, so it's recommended to ensure you have the latest version of XGBoost installed that supports Python 3.11.

To use `XGBClassifier` with Python 3.11, you can follow the standard steps for installing XGBoost and implementing the classifier. First, ensure you have the correct versions of XGBoost and other dependencies installed:

Install or upgrade XGBoost:

```bash
pip install --upgrade xgboost
```

Then, you can use `XGBClassifier` in your Python code as demonstrated in the previous examples:

```python
import xgboost as xgb
from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load dataset (Breast Cancer dataset as an example)
data = load_breast_cancer()
X, y = data.data, data.target

# Split the dataset into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create an XGBoost Classifier
xgb_classifier = xgb.XGBClassifier(objective='binary:logistic', random_state=42)

# Train the model
xgb_classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = xgb_classifier.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")
```

This example demonstrates using `XGBClassifier` from XGBoost for a classification task. Replace the dataset and adjust parameters as per your specific use case. If there are any compatibility issues with Python 3.11, checking for updates or the XGBoost community discussions might provide more insights into the current compatibility status. Always ensure to have the latest compatible versions of libraries to avoid compatibility problems.
