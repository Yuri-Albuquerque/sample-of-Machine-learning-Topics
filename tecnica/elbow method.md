The Elbow Method is a technique used to determine the optimal number of clusters in a dataset for clustering algorithms like K-means. It involves plotting the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) or distortion for different values of k and identifying the point where the rate of decrease sharply changes, forming an "elbow" in the plot. The point at which this change occurs can represent the optimal number of clusters.

While scikit-learn's KMeans class doesn't provide an explicit method for the Elbow Method, you can still implement it using KMeans and observing the WCSS for different values of k.

Here's an example demonstrating the Elbow Method using scikit-learn:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

# Generating sample data
X, _ = make_blobs(n_samples=300, centers=4, cluster_std=0.6, random_state=0)

# Calculate within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) for different values of k
wcss = []
for k in range(1, 11):  # Testing for k values from 1 to 10
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=k, init='k-means++', random_state=0)
    kmeans.fit(X)
    wcss.append(kmeans.inertia_)  # Inertia is the WCSS calculated by KMeans

# Plotting the Elbow Method graph
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.plot(range(1, 11), wcss, marker='o', linestyle='-', color='b')
plt.title('Elbow Method')
plt.xlabel('Number of Clusters (k)')
plt.ylabel('WCSS (Within-cluster Sum of Squares)')
plt.xticks(np.arange(1, 11, 1))  # Setting x-axis ticks from 1 to 10
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

Explanation of the steps:

1. **Generate Sample Data**: Synthetic data is generated using `make_blobs` from scikit-learn.

2. **Calculate WCSS for Different k values**: Iterate over a range of k values (from 1 to 10 in this example) and compute the WCSS (inertia) for each value using KMeans.

3. **Plotting the Elbow Method Graph**: Plot the number of clusters (k) against the WCSS values to create the Elbow Method graph.

The point where the decrease in WCSS sharply changes (forming an "elbow") indicates the optimal number of clusters. In this example, the optimal number of clusters might be the point where the WCSS begins to decrease at a slower rate after the "elbow" point. Adjusting the range of k values and the dataset can influence the identification of the optimal number of clusters.
